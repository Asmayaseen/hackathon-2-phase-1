# Validation Criteria
validation:
  spec_complete:
    - "All features have corresponding spec files"
    - "Specs follow the defined template"
    - "Acceptance criteria are clear and testable"

  implementation_complete:
    - "All spec features are implemented"
    - "Code follows style guidelines"
    - "Error handling is comprehensive"
    - "User experience is smooth and intuitive"

# Notes
notes: |
  Phase I is focused on establishing the foundation:
  - Spec-driven development workflow
  - Core CRUD operations
  - Clean console interface
  - In-memory data management

  Keep it simple, functional, and well-documented.
  Each feature should be fully specified before implementation.
